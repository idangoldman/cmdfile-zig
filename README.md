[![CMDFILE Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/cmdfile-0.1.0-green.svg)](https://github.com/idangoldman/cmdfile/)
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A high-performance task runner written in Zig that simplifies development workflows through declarative TOML configuration and intelligent task management. `cmdfile` is designed to be a lightweight, efficient, and user-friendly alternative to traditional task runners like Make, Just, and Taskfile.

## Why cmdfile?

**Cross-platform**: Native support for Windows, macOS, and Linux with appropriate shell handling.
**Extensible**: Easily extendable with custom commands and plugins.
**Intelligence**: Automatic dependency resolution with parallel execution and cycle detection.
**Interactive**: Supports interactive prompts and confirmations for critical tasks.
**Performance**: Native compiled binary with zero startup overhead and minimal memory footprint. Built with Zig for maximum efficiency and safety as self-contained executable with no runtime dependencies.
**Simplicity**: Clean TOML syntax without the complexity of Makefiles or language-specific DSLs.
**Testing**: Built-in testing framework for validating task configurations and execution.

### Features

- **Declarative Configuration**: Define tasks, dependencies, and environment variables in a simple TOML file.
- **Environment Variables**: Supports environment variable management for tasks.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with clear messages for configuration issues and execution failures.
- **File Watching**: Monitors file changes and re-executes tasks automatically.
- **Interactive Prompts**: Handles interactive prompts and confirmations for tasks that require user input.
- **Parallel Execution**: Runs independent tasks in parallel to speed up execution.
- **Shell Support**: Executes commands in the user's preferred shell with cross-platform compatibility.
- **Task Dependencies**: Automatically resolves task dependencies and executes them in the correct order.
- **Testing Framework**: Built-in testing framework for validating task configurations and execution.
- **Variable Substitution**: Supports variable substitution in commands using `${variable_name}` syntax.

### Alternatives

- **Cargo**: Rust package manager and build system, but limited to Rust projects and lacks cross-language support.
- **Composer**: PHP package manager with build capabilities, but limited to PHP projects and lacks cross-language support.
- **Grunt**: JavaScript task runner with a focus on configuration over code, but can be verbose and less performant than `cmdfile`.
- **Gulp**: JavaScript task runner with a focus on streaming and file manipulation, but requires Node.js and can be complex for simple tasks.
- **Just**: A command runner with a focus on simplicity and ease of use, but lacks advanced features like dependency resolution and file watching.
- **Make**: Traditional build automation tool with complex syntax and limited cross-platform support.
- **npm scripts**: JavaScript-centric task runner with limited cross-platform capabilities and dependency management.
- **Pipenv**: Python package manager with task management, but limited to Python projects and lacks cross-language support.
- **Poetry**: Python dependency management tool with task management, but limited to Python projects and lacks cross-language support.
- **Rake**: Ruby-based task runner with a focus on Ruby projects, but not suitable for cross-language tasks.
- **Taskfile**: A task runner with YAML configuration, but can be verbose and less performant than `cmdfile`.
