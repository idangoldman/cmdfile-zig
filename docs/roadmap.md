The user wants me to rewrite the roadmap in a more actionable format - essentially breaking it down into concrete, executable action items that can be done one at a time, rather than the more narrative/descriptive format I provided before. This should be more like a task list or project breakdown structure where each item is a specific, actionable task.

Looking at all the information we've discussed:
1. The schema-driven approach with simplified initial implementation
2. The target users (developers migrating from npm scripts, composer scripts, etc.)
3. The focus on DX over complexity for the first version
4. The hybrid code generation approach
5. The specific schema simplifications we discussed

I should structure this as:
- Clear, actionable items
- Each item should be specific enough to be executed
- Items should be ordered logically (dependencies)
- Each item should have a clear deliverable/outcome
- Should mention when items can be broken down further during execution

I'll organize this by major phases but make each action item concrete and executable.

# cmdfile Development Roadmap: Actionable Implementation Plan

## Overview
This roadmap breaks down cmdfile development into concrete, executable action items. Each item is designed to be completed independently or broken down into smaller sub-tasks during execution. Items are ordered by dependency and logical progression.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Breaking Down Action Items
When executing each action item:
1. Start by creating a detailed task breakdown if the item feels too large
2. Identify dependencies and prerequisites before beginning
3. Create tests before implementing functionality (TDD approach)
4. Document design decisions and trade-offs
5. Validate with simple examples before moving to complex cases

### Quality Gates
Each action item must meet:
- All tests pass on target platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- No memory leaks detected
- Performance meets established benchmarks
- Documentation updated for user-facing changes
- Breaking changes include migration path

### Risk Mitigation
- Implement MVP version of each feature before adding complexity
- Validate design decisions with real-world usage examples
- Maintain backwards compatibility within major versions
- Regular testing with real project configurations
- Community feedback integration at key milestones

This roadmap provides concrete, executable steps toward building cmdfile while maintaining flexibility to adapt based on learning and feedback during implementation.
