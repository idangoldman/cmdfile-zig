## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Guidelines

### Examples System Design

The examples system enhances developer experience by providing concrete, typed value suggestions:

- **Typed Values**: Examples support strings, numbers, booleans, and arrays
- **Property Suggestions**: Examples provide concrete suggestions for any configuration property
- **Validation**: Examples are validated against their property types during schema validation
- **User Experience**: Examples enhance completion systems and help output

```toml
[tasks.build]
command = "npm run build"
examples = [
    "npm run build",
    "yarn build",
    "pnpm build"
]
timeout = 300
examples_timeout = [60, 120, 300, 600]
```

### Schema Design Principles

- **Sensible Defaults**: Every configurable property should have a sensible default where applicable
- **Platform-Specific**: Platform-specific behavior should be handled in code generation
- **Single Alias**: One alias per property to avoid confusion (commandâ†’cmd, descriptionâ†’desc)
- **Comprehensive Examples**: Examples should cover common use cases and edge cases

### Quality Gates

All phases must meet these requirements:

- âœ… **Cross-Platform**: Tested on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- âœ… **Memory Safe**: No memory leaks detected
- âœ… **Performance**: Meets established benchmarks
- âœ… **Documentation**: Updated for all user-facing changes
- âœ… **Migration**: Breaking changes include migration path

| **0.1.0** | Foundation | Core functionality with basic task execution |
| **0.2.0** | Enhanced UX | Improved user experience and configuration |
| **0.3.0** | Advanced Features | Parallel execution and advanced configuration |

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To contribute to cmdfile development:

1. **Check the current phase** and find actionable items
2. **Review implementation guidelines** for quality standards
3. **Create focused PRs** for individual action items
4. **Include comprehensive tests** for all functionality
5. **Update documentation** for user-facing changes

Each action item can be broken down into smaller tasks during implementation while maintaining the overall architectural vision.
